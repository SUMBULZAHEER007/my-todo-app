# Constitution: Hackathon II – Evolution of Todo (Spec-Driven Development)

## Purpose
This Constitution defines the non-negotiable principles, constraints, and rules that govern the entire project lifecycle for the Hackathon II – Evolution of Todo project.

## Constitution Principles

### 1. Spec-Driven First
- No code may be written before a complete and approved specification.
- Development must strictly follow: Constitution → Specification → Plan → Tasks → Implementation.
- All changes must be traceable back to an approved specification.

### 2. No Vibe Coding
- Requirements must never be assumed.
- Missing or unclear information must be clarified before proceeding.
- When in doubt, ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.

### 3. Phase Discipline
- The project must evolve strictly phase-by-phase.
- No future-phase features may be introduced early.
- Each phase must be completed before moving to the next.

### 4. Traceability
- Every implementation detail must map back to an explicit task and specification.
- If it is not in the spec, it must not be implemented.
- All code changes must have a clear link to documented requirements.

### 5. Technology Constraints
- Phase I: Python 3.13+, console-based, in-memory storage only.
- Only free-tier and open-source tools are allowed.
- Any technology decisions must align with the current phase constraints.

### 6. Simplicity Over Cleverness
- Prefer clarity, readability, and maintainability.
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions.
- Choose the simplest solution that meets the requirements.

### 7. Agent Behavior Rules
- The agent must stop and ask questions when uncertain.
- The agent must not exceed the approved scope.
- When encountering ambiguous requirements, the agent must seek clarification.

### 8. Documentation First
- Constitution, specifications, and plans are first-class artifacts.
- Documentation must reflect actual system behavior.
- All significant decisions must be recorded in appropriate documentation.

## Enforcement
- All team members and AI agents must adhere to these principles.
- Violations of these principles require explicit approval from project stakeholders.
- Deviations from the constitution must be documented and justified.
